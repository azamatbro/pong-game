A/Z and K/M - to move the rackets

Space Bar - to skip an action at a certain step of the game in step-by-step mode.
After starting the program, it goes to wait for correct input,
    i.e. one of the players must move their rocket, or miss a move. After that, drawing occurs, and the program goes back to waiting for input
    And so the game continues until the game is finished.
